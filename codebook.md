### General infomations
Tidy dataset built from train and tests handled data.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate abilities to collect, work with, and clean a datasets.

The base files are available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
And a full data description can be find out [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

### Data Set Resume
Data originated form experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, it were captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.


### Data Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Data features
Mean and standard deviation was calculated for sixty six features, and six activity labels were applied for data:
- LAYING
- SITTING
- STANDING
- WALKING
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
